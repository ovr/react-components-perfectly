This is a React component that encapsulates YouTube IFrame Player API and exposes configuration:

```javascript
<YoutubePlayer videoId="RnBT9uUYb1w"/>
```

    <YoutubePlayer videoId="RnBT9uUYb1w" />

If you define a fenced code block with a language flag it will be rendered as a regular Markdown code snippet:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
```
